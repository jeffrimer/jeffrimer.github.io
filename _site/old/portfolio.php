	<p class="top">This page lists a short compilation of the more complex projects I completed through my coursework at
	Macomb Community College.  As I continue taking courses and doing other work, I will update this page with the client's
    permission.</p>

    <div class="portfolioListHead">Bob's Book Nook (college coursework)<a href="http://fa-iwp-01.macomb.edu/rimerj162500/itwp2300/BobsBookNook6/admin.aspx">link</a></div>
	<div class="portfolioListBody">This was written in VB.NET and interacts with an Access database.  The purpose of the page is to act like a simple
    internet book store.  The page linked to is an Admin page where books can be added or deleted, as well as book categories and
    authors.  The <a href="http://fa-iwp-01.macomb.edu/rimerj162500/itwp2300/BobsBookNook6/default.aspx"> default.aspx</a> link
    on the bottom of the admin page links to the search page of the book store that can search by author, category, or by best
    seller (all of which are different tables in the database).<br /><br />
    The page was designed to be functional more than aesthetic.</div>

	<div class="portfolioListHead">Ashland Soccer (college coursework)<a href="http://fa-iwp-01.macomb.edu/rimerj162500/itwp2300/ASHLAND_SOCCER/default.aspx">link</a></div>
	<div class="portfolioListBody">This was written in VB.NET and interacts with an Access database.  The site pulls from the
    database to populate three dropdown lists and then fills a GridView with the selected item from one of the lists.  The
    purpose of the site is to show the schedule for a soccer team based on the criteria provided in the dropdown lists.<br /><br />
    Again, the site was designed to be functional rather than aesthetic.</div>

    <div class="portfolioListHead">NorthPoint Elementary (college coursework)<a href="/projects/northpoint_site/default.html">link</a></div>
    <div class="portfolioListBody">This is a mock-up of a fictional elementary school website. It was created for a JavaScript course. The simple site features custom JavaScript used for the rotating images in the sidebar and the form validation and submission confirmation on the contact us page.  jQuery is used for the alternating rows on the staff page, and YUI is used for the calendar appointment functionality.</div>
